              In order to adopt one of our adorable pets your name must be added
              to the list of those looking to adopt. Please keep in mind, while
              you can view all our furry friends, only those up for immediate
              adoption will be available. We are a fair Adoption service that
              believe all pets should be given the chance for a loving home
            </p>
